# Overview
----------------
The main emphasis on this project, currently is to serve as a cursory app for hacking and working with Android and embroidery.
This has lead to some spin-off functionality and utilities like EmbroideryIO which also shares parentage with `EmbroiderPy/pyembroidery` and `Embroidermodder/libembroidery`.

Current features
----------------

Loading and saving is possible between many different formats. This functionality is part of the EmbroideryIO project which is a sister project to this one.

Currently we have the ability to view .DST,.EXP, .JEF, .PCS, .PEC, .PES, .SEW, .XXX, etc designs.

The EmbroideryIO project includes 40+ formats for reading and 10+ for writing.
